RVCop64
=======

This is a fork of RVCop64 - a firmware for [The Orange Cartridge][1] - 
that implements a
RISC-V co-processor for the 6510/8502 processor in the C64/C128.  The
RISC-V processor is based on [VexRiscv][2] and implements the RV32IM
architecture. Integration of peripherals such as external RAM, SD-card
and USB is done though the [LiteX][3] framework.

This fork supports `rv32imacfds` instructions if `--with-fpu --with-rvc` is selected - see below.
Note that due to the FPGA limits, dual-core CPUs cannot be configured with FPU support.

The bitstream includes an EXROM containing [BASIC extensions](doc/basic.md)
and a [machine code monitor](doc/rvmon.md).

For machine code programmers, there are some extra
[I/O registers](doc/ioregs.md) provided for communication between the
6510/8502 and the RISC-V co-processor.

For debugging via USB, serial port or JTAG, please see the
[debugging](doc/debugging.md) documentation.


Building
--------

After cloning the repository, make sure you run `git submodule update --init --recursive` on the toplevel directory.

To build the bitstream, go to the `hw` directory and run the python script
`bitstream.py`:
Warning: there's some heavy dependencies to your build-environment, especially when rebuilding the CPU core is necessary.

Example for building a single core CPU featuring FPU support with 80MHz frequency, with the console via USB:
```sh
$ cd hw
$ python3 bitstream.py --platform=orangecart --uart=usb_acm --cpu=vexriscv_smp --sys-clk-freq=80e6 --cpu-count=1 --with-fpu --with-rvc
```
Note that `--with-wishbone-memory` is silently passed to the vexriscv_smp cpu-specific options, as this is needed to get a working bitstream for this board based on the SMP CPU.

If all goes well, the bitstream will be created as
`build/gateware/orangecart.bit` under the `hw` directory.
Expect one warning about the use of IDDRXN and ODDRXN primitives on the
same pin.

There are a number of arguments that can be passed to the `bitstream.py`
script:

> --platform {orangecart}

Specifies the hardware platform to target.  This is a mandatory argument.
Currently only the value `orangecart` is valid.

> --cpu {vexriscv,vexriscv_smp}

Specifies which CPU core to choose. `vexriscv` is the *original* one, lightweigt. `vexriscv_smp` features more options, including several Riscv ISAs: ISA F/D/C in addition and SMP support. Checkout all options using `--help`.

> --sys-clk-freq _SYS_CLK_FREQ_

Changes the clock frequency of the RISC-V processor from the default of
64 MHz.  The speed should be specified in Hz.  If increasing the frequency,
please watch out for warnings from `nextpnr` about failure to close timing.
If decreasing the frequency, be aware that too low frequency can cause
the external RAM to malfunction.

> --uart {serial,usb_acm,jtag_uart,crossover}

Changes the connection of the RISC-V processor's built-in serial port.
By default it is connected to a virtual UART which is accessed through
the `rvterm` BASIC command.  Specifying `serial` connects it to the
physical serial port pins (J2) instead.  Specifying `usb_acm` connects
it to the USB port, as an ACM device.  Specifying `jtag_uart` connects
it to the JTAG, for use with `litex_term jtag`.  Specifying `crossover`
connects it to a virtual UART accessible through [`litex_server`][4]
(please also enable one or more debug ports).

> --uart2 {vuart,serial,usb_acm,jtag_uart,crossover}

Adds a second built-in serial port to the RISC-V processor.  It offers the
same set of connections as the primary serial port, but the two ports must
not use the same connection.  By default no secondary serial port is added;
explicitly specify `vuart` to get a second serial port connected to the
virtual UART connected to `rvterm`.

> --usb {eptri,simplehostusb,debug}

Adds custom USB functionality.  This argument can not be used together
with `--uart usb_acm`.  The value `debug` adds a USB bridge for
[`litex_server`][4].  The values `eptri` and `simplehostusb` adds register
interfaces for USB device and USB host respectively, which can be used by
the software running on the RISC-V processor.

> --jtag-debug

Adds a JTAG bridge for [`litex_server`][4].  This argument can not be used
together with `--uart jtag_uart`.

> --serial-debug

Adds a serial port (J2) bridge for [`litex_server`][4].  This argument
can not be used together with `--uart serial`.

> --serial-debug-baudrate _SERIAL_DEBUG_BAUDRATE_

Sets the baudrate for the serial port debug bridge enabled with
`--serial-debug`.  The default is 115200 bps.

> --seed _SEED_

Specifies a random seed for `nextpnr`.  In case routing fails, trying a
different seed might help.  This should normally not be needed.

Releases
--------

For your convenience there may appear some pre-built bitstreams under releases. Besides the bitstream itself, I may provide also the device tree specs in source `.dts` and binary `.dtb` formats. These may be useful to be used in conjunction with the RiscV Linux port - see here: [Linux-on-LiteX-VexRiscv][5]

The bitstreams in detail

| Bitstream                             | Description                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| RVCop64-rv32ima.tar.gz                | 64MHz, C64 RVTerm, Single-core, ISA - I/A/M              |
| RVCop64-rv32i2p0_mafdc.tar.gz         | 80MHz, C64 RVTerm, Single-core, ISA - I/A/M/C/F/D        |
| RVCop64-usb_acm-rv32ima.tar.gz        | 80MHz,  USB ACM Terminal, Single-core, ISA - I/A/M       |
| RVCop64-usb_acm-rv32i2p0_mac.tar.gz   | 80MHz,  USB ACM Terminal, Dual-core, ISA - I/A/M/C       |
| RVCop64-usb_acm-rv32i2p0_mafdc.tar.gz | 80MHz,  USB ACM Terminal, Single-core, ISA - I/A/M/C/F/D |

To access the Litex console you may use `litex_term /dev/ttyACM0` or its variants to get some software running (e.g. use the option `--kernel=my-prog.bin`) for USB ACM Terminal supported bitstreams.
Checkout the other options related to connectivity [here][6].

Note: the Linux port was tested - as a principle PoC; due to OrangeCart's RAM limitations, Linux has to use the sdcard rootfs, making the whole system fairly slow. I successfully showed principle functioning of the OrangeCarts features, such as C64 memory access.

Further information
-------------------

### Memory Layout
To make this bitstream compatible with the used VexRiscV-SMP CPU, some memory mappings needed to be changed compared to the original RVCop64 layout:
```
litex> mem_list
Available memory regions:
OPENSBI   0x40f00000 0x80000 
PLIC      0xf0c00000 0x400000 
CLINT     0xf0010000 0x10000 
SRAM      0x10000000 0x4000 
MAIN_RAM  0x40000000 0x1000000 
ROM       0x00000000 0xc000 
C64       0x0f000000 0x10000 
CSR       0xf0000000 0x10000 
```
Under Linux, in order to access C64 memory, one needs to `mmap(...)` the desired C64 memory region.
Under Zephyr, the application program needs to take explicit care to access the right memory reagion.
